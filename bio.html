      <h2>His Early life</h2>
      <p>
        On September 27, 1954, David Olaniyi Oyedepo was born in
        Osogbo, Nigeria, but is a native of Omu-Aran, Irepodun
        Local Government Area of Kwara State. He was raised in a
        mixed religious family. His father, Ibrahim, was a Muslim
        healer. His mother, Dorcas, was a member of the Holy
        Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&S),
        a branch of the Aladura movement in Nigeria. He was
        raised by his grandmother in Osogbo, who introduced him
        to the virtues of Christian life via early morning
        prayers which she attended with him. She also taught him
        the importance of tithing.

      <h2>His Ministry</h2>

      <p>
        Oyedepo was "born again" in 1969, through the influence
        of his teacher, Betty Lasher, who took an interest in him
        during his high school days.. According to him, he
        received a mandate from God through an 18-hour vision in
        May 1981, to liberate the world from all oppression of
        the devil through the preaching of the word of faith.
        This is the inaugural vision that led to the founding of
        the Living Faith Church World Wide (LFCWW), first called
        Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981.Two years
        later, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye,
        General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God,
        ordained David and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (known
        as Faith Abiola Oyedepo) to become pastors and officially
        commissioned the new church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five years later, Oyedepo was ordained as Bishop. Living
        Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel International) started
        in Kaduna but moved to Lagos, the former capital of
        Nigeria in July 1989, to start a new branch of the church
        after Oyedepo claimed to have received instructions from
        God to reach out to the people of Lagos. Oyedepo is the
        wealthiest preacher in Nigeria with a net worth of over
        US$150 million. The church owns four private jets and
        several buildings, including in London and the US.
        Oyedepo is an author and publisher who has written over
        70 titles apart from periodicals. He is the
        chairman/publisher of Dominion Publishing House (DPH), a
        publishing arm of the ministry. DPH has over 4 million
        prints in circulation to date. Through Oyedepo; Covenant
        University, Faith Academy and Kingdom Heritage Model
        Schools have been established to equip the youth for
        global impact. The construction of a third university
        named Crown University is already underway, located in
        Calabar, Cross River, Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1998, Oyedepo claimed he was instructed by God to
        build a new base for the Commission to accommodate the
        increasing number of worshippers. This resulted in
        Oyedepo's church's acquisition of the initial 530-acre
        (2.1 km2) facility, known as Canaanland, which serves as
        the headquarters. It is the home of the 50,000-seat
        capacity auditorium, the 'Faith Tabernacle'. This was a
        feat also recorded by the Guinness Book of Records. Faith
        Tabernacle was reported as the Worlds' Largest Church
        Auditorium in December 2005 Construction was completed
        within 12 months. Reports also claimed that this building
        was built debt free.[7][8] This 50,000-seat edifice was
        dedicated on September 18, 1999, under the administration
        of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. [9] Canaanland is
        in Ota, Ogun state and is the 5,000-acre (20 km2) estate
        and campus, that houses The 50,000 seat auditorium, the
        church secretariat, the church's youth chapel, a primary
        school called Kingdom heritage model school, a full
        boarding mission secondary school called Faith Academy,
        with over 1,500 students and the Covenant University
        facilities -[10] which accommodates over 7,000 students,
        fully resident in ultra-modern hostel facilities - with
        fully equipped faculty buildings and numerous staff
        housing facilities. Canaanland campus also has for-profit
        establishments operated by the church such as a bakery, a
        bottled water processing plant, a petrol station, various
        restaurants and shopping stores, several residential
        houses that provide for the over 2,000 church employees
        and guesthouses. Four banks are also present on this
        Estate, three of which are branches of external
        commercial banks and one which is a community and
        micro-finance Bank and operated by the Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole of Canaanland which includes a proposed 15,000
        housing estate known as Canaan City had increased to
        17,000 acres as at 2012.[11] The Ministry's biggest
        annual meeting Shiloh, holds every December in the same
        Faith Tabernacle and often welcomes thousands of
        congregants across the world.

      Hagin, E. W. Kenyon, T. L. Osborn, Smith Wigglesworth as
      well as renowned Nigerian preachers; Enoch Adeboye and the
      late Benson Idahosa as mentors. As with many of his
      influences, Oyedepo has been described as a preacher of the
      prosperity gospel. Winners Chapel International operates a
      Bible training programme known as the Word of Faith Bible
      Institute for members and non-members alike to develop
      knowledge of Christian principles as well as to develop
      leaders and future pastors. The institute is run in major
      branches of the Church. Oyedepo is the president of David
      Oyedepo Ministries International (DOMI). DOMI is the
